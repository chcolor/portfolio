				<h1>Inspired By&#58;</h1>
				<h2>Sum&#58; Forty Tales from the Afterlives</h2>
				<p>This book is a collection of short stories by David Eagleman. In it you will find 40 stories about possible afterlives. The afterlife is an interesting concept in that we have no way of knowing if it even exists. Any one of Mr. Eagleman's afterlives could be quite possible, in fact, they might all be true. It is this thought that lead me to the idea "What if one could choose their afterlife?" Many religions have differing views about what happens to us after death and, having recently studied Buddhism and Hinduism, I am intrigued by the idea that the choices you make in this life might affect your position in the grand scheme of things long after your death.</p>
				<p>By creating the possibility of choosing your own eternity I feel that many things would change in the world as we know it. I thought that one way to make such a future possible would be to combine the once popular idea of cryonics with the inspiration from the movie "Vanilla Sky." Combining these ideas  would make it possible to, in my imaginary world, put someone in a state of limbo where there body is not ageing but their mind is active and capable of processing stimuli fed to it through programmed impulses, allowing them to feel as though they are actually experiencing life.

				<h1>Who is Daedalus&#63;</h1>
				<p>I thought the name Daedalus Designs rather fitting because Daedalus was a craftsman according to ancient Greek mythology. After doing some research, the name fit better than I could have imagined. Daedalus was first introduced by Homer who altered the word daidala, which stands for finely crafted things. He introduced us to Daedalus as the creator of the labyrinth on Crete that held the giant Minotaur. </p>
				<p>The tale continues with Daedalus and his son, Icarus, being locked in a tower so he might never divulge the secrets of the labyrinth. In a desperate attempt to free himself and Icarus from their captivity, Daedalus creates wings out of feathers and wax. The wings work well and before they set off, Daedalus warns Icarus not to fly too close to the sun because that would melt the wax. Icarus, a typical young man, does not heed his father's advice and soars futher and further upward until, indeed, the sun melts the wax and Icarus plumets to his death. The moral of the story? Never tempt fate and listen to your father. </p>

				<h1>Design Decisions</h1>
				<p>
				The design started with the logo and the company name. Admittedly was inspired by the song Icarus by Bastille which I could not stop humming for days. From the name Icarus I began thinking about the wings that he wore and what kind of a master craftsman would have created such things. After a little research I found out that Daedalus was the craftsman's name and that he also had designed the labyrinth. This is where my mind began to fly. I already had my original idea, of a company that designed elaborate virtual realities that would allow the consumer to feel as though they were living an eternity of their choice and I felt that this would be something Daedalus would have loved to design. </p>
				<p>The sky background came from the wings in the logo. Creating the gradient was a bit of a challenge because I was trying to go from an image to plain white. I decided on the horizontal rules, which are actually div's with no content as the hr tag has been phased out, because something was needed to create a break between the logo and the content.

				<h1>Color Scheme Decisions</h1>
				<p>I went with a pale color scheme and rather nondescript photos to add a sense of other-worldliness to the design. I found the photo of the Buddha and felt that it really went with the idea of a chosen afterlife as Buddhism is one of the few belief systems that entertain reincarnation. The photos were found through a fair use website which listed all the photos as being free to use for public, private, or commercial use with or without attribution. I kept text blocks in manageable sized chunks in order to alleviate the burden on the visitor. I feel the photos add a nice visual break from the text itself.

				On the Contact page I added a simple form as well as an email link and a button that opens to Kickstarter. I feel these additions make the site feel more authentic and creates interest for the visitor.
