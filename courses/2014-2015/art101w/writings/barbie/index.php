<p class="txtblk center">This image, an advertisement for the Barbie doll from 1965, is a travesty. Found on the Neat Designs website, <a href="http://neatdesigns.net" target="_blank"> Neatdesigns.net</a>, this ad stood out to me because even though the product is about women, it does nothing to further the cause of women’s equality. In fact, it sets women back. Feeding into the social norms of society at the time, it would not have stood out as controversial then; however, I feel that this is no excuse to reinforce stereotypes in impressionable young girls. I feel that this ad reflects an ideology that women are strictly decorative objects, it excludes vast swathes of American society, and confines the role of women to that of wife, mother, and homemaker. It is easy for me to see how ads of this nature and the products behind them built the wall that feminists of the late twentieth and twenty-first century have been climbing.</p> 
<p class="txtblk center">Taking a look at the ad itself, it depicts a woman embracing her daughter with a look of adoration and love while the little girl plays with her Barbie dolls. The child gazes back with loving respect for her mother. Both mother and daughter are well-groomed and not a single hair lays out of place. The mother sports a beautiful manicure and the perfect amount of makeup to make her respectable and not indecent. They both wear nice clothes. They’re thin, white, and attractive. Three blurbs sit to the right hand side, one of which reads “Mommy, do blue shoes go with a green dress?” The girl holds a doll with bobbed blonde hair, just like her mother. In front of these figures is an array of Barbie paraphernalia. There is a rack of clothes for Barbie to change into, all dresses from what I can see. There is a hair styling hood dryer with a wig on a stand underneath. On the floor lay some curlers, brushes and hair dyeing chemicals. In the bottom left corner another doll sits in a chair wearing a stylish dress and shoes. This doll also wears her hair in a bob only this time the doll has brown hair. All of this carefully posed action is underscored with a paragraph of text explaining that this set of toys will aid you in teaching your daughter the things she will need to know for the future, and is punctuated with the statement that “Mommies and little girls all over America and in 30 foreign countries share the delight of Barbie.”</p>
 
<p class="txtblk center">This ad is targeting a very specific demographic, mothers of young girls. To achieve their goal of having women purchase this item, Barbie depicts the product as a catalyst for bonding between a mother and her daughter. The imagery that has been delicately constructed depicts an environment that mothers of young girls might crave, a woman spending quality time with her daughter, molding her experiences, and teaching her values that will help her in the future. The values that this product is intended to cultivate are very specific, that of personal appearance and proper grooming. It models specific behavior for both the child and the parent, insinuating that all “good girls” want to play with Barbie dolls and all “good mommies” buy their daughters these dolls.</p>

<p class="txtblk center">I think that the values taught by this product are deplorable. This “doll” promotes an unhealthy and unattainable body image. I can’t believe the proportions that they have given her: a huge bust, a tiny waist, fleshy hips, and a full rear end. Combine this with the exaggerated length and incredible thinness of her arms, legs, and neck, and Barbie begins to seem more to me like a martian than the average human female. It would be anatomically impossible for a human woman to achieve these measurements. In addition, I feel that teaching impressionable young girls to value their looks over everything else can only end in disaster. When a young girl is told that her intrinsic value lies in her appearance, she is given a finite amount of wealth that she must make sure to spend before it expires. I am sure this leads to many poor decisions in regards to finding a husband and starting a family. It is easy for me to imagine that someone who feels that their beauty time bomb is ticking might marry someone that is less than ideal as a life-partner. I imagine that his also leads to women taking drastic and life-threatening measures to maintain their beauty at all cost. Today we understand how impressionable young girls are and how much damage can be caused by an unhealthy body image. I am deeply saddened by the amount of talent, intelligence, and accomplishment that must have been suppressed and wasted by a generation of women who were valued solely by their outward appearance.</p> 
<p class="txtblk center">Furthermore, I feel that this advertisement is far from acceptable in regard to today’s standards for diversity as well. This ivory skinned Barbie doll is being played with by a little white girl, supervised by her alabaster skinned mother who instructs her in how to care for her caucasian hair and which clothes might be most flattering for her milky skin tone. This frustrates me even more when I read that last line of text again, “Mommies and little girls all over America and in 30 foreign countries share the delight of Barbie.” I imagine all those little girls around the world playing with this Barbie doll, learning that Americans are very tall, very thin, and very white. Of course, this is not only offensive because of the lack of racial diversity, but also because of the lack of gender diversity and it’s strict conformity to gender stereotypes. This ad as well as this product make it perfectly clear that the Barbie world is a world for girls. I see no room for boys who like to play with dolls instead of GI Joes or even for girls who prefer racecars and science experiments to hair dryers and high heels. Of course Barbie has gotten better in the last 50 years, but the fact is that the roles Barbie plays are still stereotypically female roles. I am infuriated at the thought that Barbie and companies like it have allowed these biases to continue for as long as they have, and even now the small concessions being made pale in comparison to the amount of material that feeds into them still.</p>
<p class="txtblk center">While the causes of women’s equality and gender neutrality have come a long way since the 1960’s, there is still a long road ahead for America and the rest of the world. In today’s society women are allowed into the workforce and able to hold almost any position, but we still only get paid a fraction of that which our male counterparts are paid. It is still frowned upon in some circles for girls to want to build things and for boys to like things that are pretty. I have seen the pain that can be inflicted on a man who doesn’t watch sports and experienced the scrutiny that comes with being a woman who likes to wear flannel in an incredibly conservative atmosphere. Hopefully, my future son or daughter might live in a world where they are accepted for who they are, as they are, and not be forced into some mold that someone else made for them.</p>
