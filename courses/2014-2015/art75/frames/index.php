<p class="txtblk center">This video is compiled from 30 individual videos that I shot around the San Jose area. The prompt for the project was to create a 30 second video comprised of clips focused on framing. Each video was supposed to transition to the next in an intentional way. I decided to take a principle of photography and see how it translated into video. The result is an interesting mashup of ambient sound and diverse locations.</p></div>
