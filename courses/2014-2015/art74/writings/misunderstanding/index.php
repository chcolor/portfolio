 <h2 class="center">7 Ways of Misunderstanding Interactive Art</h2>
 <img src="images/banner1.jpg"></div>
 
 <p class="txtblk center"> The essay I am responding to can be read here: <a href="bit.ly/7interactiveart"> Interactive Art</a>&nbsp;(Links to an external site.)</p>
 <p class="txtblk center">Interactive Art, using the dictionary definition of interactivity, has been around for centuries, since the first carpenter built the first beautiful chair. Interactive Art which utilizes technology has a long history as well. Picture a beautiful grandfather clock. This is both technology as well as art and it is interactive in that the clock must be wound in order to continue running. Granted, these are examples of functional art, which generally falls into it’s own category, but it is my feeling that something must first be appreciated solely for it’s beauty before these techniques are included in our everyday lives.  While the author of the paper is speaking about interactive art in the high art world, I can’t help but relate it to the things that have permeated our lives because all of these things were considered high art at one time or another. With this in mind, to call interactive art a recent phenomenon is certainly a huge misunderstanding.</p>
 <p class="txtblk center">In the second section speaking on the validity of Interactive pieces as art the author states “Interactivity is seen by many cultural elitists as a fad, inseparable from the all-pervasive banal discourses of technoculture.” I feel that these "cultural elitists suffer from an incredibly misguided viewpoint. Increasingly, the lives of people around the globe are becoming inseparably tied to technology. As this connection becomes more universal, so does the need for our art to be accessible to people who live their lives on and through computers.</p>
 <p class="txtblk center">Speaking on the difference of interactive artwork versus interactive applications, the author states that interactive applications “use interactivity as an operational strategy and aim at reducing it along the way, opting for a closure.”  This is a key to my understanding of the difference between the two. The goal with interactive applications is to seamlessly incorporate said application into your daily routine or repertoire without too much interference by the “interface,” it should “blend in.”  The goal of interactive artwork is, however, to make the viewer aware of their participation in said artwork. It brings focus to the way in which humans interact with their surroundings, real or virtual, making no effort to blend in, but rather to stand out.</p>
 <p class="txtblk center">The next misunderstanding discussed focuses on the role of the artist in the art. This is a timeless argument that has been had about every medium throughout history. The author states. “Even though the presence of the artist is usually hidden behind the scenes, it can be inferred.” This is a statement that can be made about any genre of art outside of performance art and a few select others. The thought that artists could be inconsequential in their own artwork is laughable.</p>
 <p class="txtblk center">The question of how little interactivity still constitutes interactive art is an interesting question, however the point of interactive art is to highlight the action of the participants so a painting that can transform from one vantage point to the next could arguably be considered interactive art.  As the author states, “there are works which deliberately restrict the possibilities of interaction as part of their artistic strategy.” In these cases the restriction is the crux of the piece.</p>
 <p class="txtblk center">The difference between interacting with others versus introspection and the possibility of these actions feeding into ones narcissism is a point without distinction. Any activity can become narcissistic if the originator acts in such a way as to drive the interaction that direction. An “intra-action” need not be a narcissistic act. The best growth a person can do is done while looking inward. While the author defends Interactive artwork by describing the framework as an “entity” I feel that she is discounting the power of self-reflection as a catalyst for change.</p>
 <p class="txtblk center">Lastly, in regards to interactive art as masculine or feminine I feel that, while men dominate many things in this world, I certainly wouldn’t label those things as masculine. While it is true that men have been the main founders of tech since its inception, women have been the consumers. Coming from a family where my father was an industrial painter and my mother worked at a bank, it was my mother and not my father who interacted with technology most. So how would you describe an item that has been designed by men for women? I find this dynamic very interesting in its own right because these men are inherently incapable of understanding the female perspective but they are tasked with trying. Is that a masculine act?</p></div>

 <h2>Five Principles of New Media: Or, Playing Lev Manovich</h2>
 <img src="images/banner2.jpg"></div>
 <p class="txtblk center">The following essay is my response to “Five Principles of New Media: Or, Playing Lev Manovich” by Madeleine Sorapure which can be found here: <a href="http://bit.ly/playinglev">Playing Lev</a> (Links to an external site.)</p>
 <p class="txtblk center">In this essay, Sorapure lists the 5 principles of new media as Numerical Representation, Modularity, Automation, Variability, and Transcoding.</p>

<p class="txtblk center">Sorapure references Numerical Representation as the closest to “Materiality” we can get in regards to new media. She states that “all new media objects can be described mathematically and can be manipulated via algorithms.” I feel that, frequently in this era, this description can be used in reference to more and more of our lives. We are living more and more in the realm of the electronic than we are in the physical. I cringe when I think of how many times I was given the impression, or told outright, that learning mathematics beyond basic Algebra was useless because people don’t use it in their daily lives.</p>

<p class="txtblk center">Sorapure goes on to talk about Modularity. The idea behind modularity being that a single element can be used again and again in different circumstances and still maintain its functionality. Sorapure describes this in reference to Photoshop, stating that “modularity is most evident in layers; a single image can be composed of many layers, each of which can be treated as an entirely independent and separate entity.” To me, this means the capability of using the same source images over and over again without deterioration, copying layers and manipulating them individually. This is virtually impossible in traditional art. Previously, things could be copied from books and magazines and collaged but photocopying was notorious for the diminishing quality of the second. Now with things like Photoshop and color printers readily available and in homes around the world, making art is cheaper than ever. Sure, the cost of entry might be high considering the price of the hardware and software involved in creating new media art, but it is conceivable that these costs are one time only costs, after that, the pixels are free. Contrast that with traditional painting where one needs to continually buy expensive paints and canvas or other materials in order to paint and the learning curve is often steep and you see that digital art has allowed expression to become much more inclusive than ever before.</p>

<p class="txtblk center">This concept of Modularity allowing things to become cheaper dovetails nicely with the next concept of Automation. Automation allows the computer to do more of the work so that the user can be focused more on what they want to do instead of how to accomplish it. Going back to the example of traditional painting for a moment, a lot of the teaching of painting revolves around technique and understanding the tools of the medium: memorizing formulas to mix the right colors, learning which brushes make which strokes, finding just the right type of canvas to suit your painting style. All of these things were conscious decisions that the artist needed to make before ever putting the first color to canvas. With New Media, using a program like photoshop removes those headaches. If the new media artist wants to paint something orange, they simply choose a brush, select the color, and let the computer sort out the rest. they don’t need to find the algorithm for paintbrush, or memorize the formula for orange. These things have already been done and they will continue to work in that exact way, every time the artist has a need for it.</p>

<p class="txtblk center">Sorapure quotes Manovich directly when referencing variability, “a new media object is not something fixed once and for all, but something that can exist in different, potentially infinite versions.” This is a wonderful quality of new media. No other time in history have we been capable of having our cake and eating it too. In painting, mistakes cost something: time, effort, materials. With new media there is an undo button which allows you to experiment and change anything and everything you want. Manovich’s statement is alluding to something grander even. Previously, once something got printed into a newspaper, there was no going back. If there was an error, you could print a retraction but the original error existed forever and without reference to the error itself. In New Media, if a huge Media outlet accidentally posts the wrong headline to an article, they can change it directly, and unless you cached the site previously, no one would be the wiser.</p>

<p class="txtblk center">Transcoding, the last of the five principles, states that New Media is capable of existing in many different forms at once. It can exist on your desktop computer, in your iPhone, on your Kindle, or be broadcast to your television. Previously, if you wanted a lighter book, you had to wait for the softcover version to be released.</p>

<p class="txtblk center">So, according to these five principles, New Media has transformed the way we view the world by making it both more complex, and simpler than ever before. By making it more accessible to everyone, we have expanded the world in which we live and also made it smaller.</p>
