 <h2 class="center">7 Ways of Misunderstanding Interactive Art</h2>
 <img src="../../../../../images/banner3.png"></div>
 
 <p class="txtblk center"> The essay I am responding to can be read here: <a href="bit.ly/7interactiveart"> Interactive Art</a>&nbsp;(Links to an external site.)</p>
 <p class="txtblk center">Interactive Art, using the dictionary definition of interactivity, has been around for centuries, since the first carpenter built the first beautiful chair. Interactive Art which utilizes technology has a long history as well. Picture a beautiful grandfather clock. This is both technology as well as art and it is interactive in that the clock must be wound in order to continue running. Granted, these are examples of functional art, which generally falls into it’s own category, but it is my feeling that something must first be appreciated solely for it’s beauty before these techniques are included in our everyday lives.  While the author of the paper is speaking about interactive art in the high art world, I can’t help but relate it to the things that have permeated our lives because all of these things were considered high art at one time or another. With this in mind, to call interactive art a recent phenomenon is certainly a huge misunderstanding.</p>
 <p class="txtblk center">In the second section speaking on the validity of Interactive pieces as art the author states “Interactivity is seen by many cultural elitists as a fad, inseparable from the all-pervasive banal discourses of technoculture.” I feel that these "cultural elitists suffer from an incredibly misguided viewpoint. Increasingly, the lives of people around the globe are becoming inseparably tied to technology. As this connection becomes more universal, so does the need for our art to be accessible to people who live their lives on and through computers.</p>
 <p class="txtblk center">Speaking on the difference of interactive artwork versus interactive applications, the author states that interactive applications “use interactivity as an operational strategy and aim at reducing it along the way, opting for a closure.”  This is a key to my understanding of the difference between the two. The goal with interactive applications is to seamlessly incorporate said application into your daily routine or repertoire without too much interference by the “interface,” it should “blend in.”  The goal of interactive artwork is, however, to make the viewer aware of their participation in said artwork. It brings focus to the way in which humans interact with their surroundings, real or virtual, making no effort to blend in, but rather to stand out.</p>
 <p class="txtblk center">The next misunderstanding discussed focuses on the role of the artist in the art. This is a timeless argument that has been had about every medium throughout history. The author states. “Even though the presence of the artist is usually hidden behind the scenes, it can be inferred.” This is a statement that can be made about any genre of art outside of performance art and a few select others. The thought that artists could be inconsequential in their own artwork is laughable.</p>
 <p class="txtblk center">The question of how little interactivity still constitutes interactive art is an interesting question, however the point of interactive art is to highlight the action of the participants so a painting that can transform from one vantage point to the next could arguably be considered interactive art.  As the author states, “there are works which deliberately restrict the possibilities of interaction as part of their artistic strategy.” In these cases the restriction is the crux of the piece.</p>
 <p class="txtblk center">The difference between interacting with others versus introspection and the possibility of these actions feeding into ones narcissism is a point without distinction. Any activity can become narcissistic if the originator acts in such a way as to drive the interaction that direction. An “intra-action” need not be a narcissistic act. The best growth a person can do is done while looking inward. While the author defends Interactive artwork by describing the framework as an “entity” I feel that she is discounting the power of self-reflection as a catalyst for change.</p>
 <p class="txtblk center">Lastly, in regards to interactive art as masculine or feminine I feel that, while men dominate many things in this world, I certainly wouldn’t label those things as masculine. While it is true that men have been the main founders of tech since its inception, women have been the consumers. Coming from a family where my father was an industrial painter and my mother worked at a bank, it was my mother and not my father who interacted with technology most. So how would you describe an item that has been designed by men for women? I find this dynamic very interesting in its own right because these men are inherently incapable of understanding the female perspective but they are tasked with trying. Is that a masculine act?</p>
